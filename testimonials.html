          “I've been using Whatify daily for the past six months and that part of my life is now missing. Whatify has taken the weight off my shoulders and filled that destructive whole that has held me back. Sometimes I just let it run on my desktop at home and I am free to live a regular life” <small> - Faye T</small><br><br></h6>

          “I can’t stand that feeling of not being present in the world- feeling like i’m on the outside looking in. Whatify helps me able to actually maintain relationships, cope with my job and do it well. Im getting married this spring!! This doesn't mean life is absolutely perfect in everyway, but now I can "get back on the horse" as they say... Now I get the crumbs... I'm content now”<small> - Elijah I</small></h6></p>

        "I was barely able to take care of myself. I had nothing to lose. My mind wouldn't stop, it was totally out of control. There was a dark blizzard blinding my actions. Whatify is so easy to use and started woring almost immediately. The first time I used it experienced vertigo. I could feel that part of myself distancing from my perception as it started rendering my anxieties on Whatify's prossecors. I feel like a upgradded my brain's random access memory, freeing my energy. I feel sharp as a stalactite."<small> - Abrahim M</small></h6>

        "This is absolutely the best software if you’re tired, afraid, worried most of the time and think that you could feel this way for a long time without some kind of miracle. This was a miracle for me. It gave me so much useful and practical information that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. It gave me hope and what’s even better is that it gave me the confidence to know I can do it. This has been an eyeopener. Thank you Whatify!”<small> - Rachel E</small></h6>
